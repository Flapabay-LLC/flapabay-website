      <div>
        <p>Travel has always been about discovery, about finding those special places that aren't in every guidebook. In this article, we'll take you through ten incredible destinations that remain relatively undiscovered by mass tourism.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">1. Comporta, Portugal</h2>
        <p>Just an hour south of Lisbon, Comporta offers pristine beaches without the crowds of the Algarve. The laid-back atmosphere and stunning rice fields create a unique landscape that feels worlds away from the busy capital.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">2. Kyustendil, Bulgaria</h2>
        <p>Nestled in the foothills of the Osogovo mountain, this small town offers thermal springs, picturesque landscapes, and a history dating back to Roman times. Yet it remains largely unknown to international travelers.</p>
        
        <div class="my-8 rounded-lg overflow-hidden">

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">The breathtaking view from Osogovo mountain near Kyustendil</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">3. Pulau Kapas, Malaysia</h2>
        <p>While Langkawi gets all the attention, this tiny island on the east coast of Malaysia offers crystal clear waters, vibrant coral reefs, and beaches that rival any in the country – all without the development or crowds.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">4. Setenil de las Bodegas, Spain</h2>
        <p>A town quite literally built into the rock, with houses tucked under massive overhangs. Walking through the streets feels like exploring a fantasy world come to life.</p>
        
        <p class="mt-4">For our FlapaBay hosts and guests, these destinations represent opportunities to experience authentic travel moments. We encourage you to explore beyond the ordinary and find accommodations that allow you to truly connect with these special places.</p>
        
        <div class="bg-gray-100 p-5 rounded-lg my-6">
          <h3 class="font-bold mb-2">Pro Traveler Tip</h3>
          <p>When visiting hidden gems, research local transportation options in advance. Many of these places have limited public transport, and having a plan will save you time and stress.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The remaining hidden gems on our list include locations in Eastern Europe, South America, and Asia. Each offers something truly special for travelers willing to step off the typical tourist path.</p>
        
        <p class="mt-4">Stay tuned for Part 2 of our Hidden Gems series, where we'll explore unexpected urban treasures that most tourists overlook.</p>

    content: `
      <div>
        <p>The first few minutes of a guest's stay can set the tone for their entire experience. As a host, creating a thoughtful and personalized welcome is one of the most important aspects of hospitality.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">The Psychology of Welcome</h2>
        <p>First impressions matter. Research shows that guests form opinions about their stay within the first 7-10 minutes of arrival. This initial judgment can color their entire experience and ultimately impact your reviews and repeat bookings.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Essential Elements of a Great Welcome</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
          <li><strong>Clear Communication:</strong> Send detailed check-in instructions 24-48 hours before arrival</li>
          <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Use your guest's name and reference any specific needs they mentioned</li>
          <li><strong>Comfort First:</strong> Ensure the space is spotlessly clean, well-lit, and at a comfortable temperature</li>
          <li><strong>Local Touch:</strong> Include small local products or treats that showcase your area</li>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">The Perfect Welcome Guide</h2>
        <p>A well-designed welcome guide serves multiple purposes: it helps guests feel oriented, reduces repetitive questions, and showcases your knowledge as a host. Your guide should include:</p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
          <li>WiFi information (prominently displayed)</li>
          <li>How to operate essential features (heating, A/C, entertainment systems)</li>
          <li>Emergency contacts and safety information</li>
          <li>Local recommendations grouped by category (dining, activities, essentials)</li>
          <li>House rules presented in a positive tone</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="bg-primary bg-opacity-10 p-5 rounded-lg my-6 border-l-4 border-primary">
          <h3 class="font-bold mb-2">Success Story</h3>
          <p>"After implementing a more personalized welcome experience, my average rating increased from 4.7 to 4.9 stars, and I've seen a 30% increase in repeat bookings." - Maria, FlapaBay Superhost</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Remember that being a great host isn't just about having a beautiful property—it's about creating memorable experiences. Your welcome sets the stage for everything that follows.</p>
